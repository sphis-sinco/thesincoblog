I hate this.

I hate making games with other people.

I hate making stupid fucking youtube content.

I hate the fact that I still try and make something good even though I know no one fucking cares.

I hate it.

I want to die.

There is no point in living.

So it’s like. “Why the fuck am I still here?”

WHY AM I HERE?

WHY HAVEN’T I KICKED THE BUCKET YET HUH?

WHY DO I CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE SAME FUCKING BULLSHIT CYCLE IVE BEEN IN FOR LIKE 5. FUCKING YEARS.

WHY.

IM FUCKING TIRED OF THIS STUPID CYCLE.

ITS ALWAYS THE SAME SHIT

I DONT WANNA WORK ON THIS GAME ANYMORE

TAKE A BREAK

WORK ON A NEW GAME OR THE SAME GAME

RINSE AND FUCKING REPEAT UNTIL I CAN’T DO IT BUT THEN WHEN IM BACK IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.

5.

Fucking.

Years.

There’s no one to fucking care.

No one does care.

Hell I bet the person reading this right now YES YOU.

Just fucking found it or was bored and decided to click on the damn link I put in my discord server that no one fucking uses.

No one fucking uses that stupid thing yet I kept making more servers.

Kept making more games.

Kept working with other people.

This cycle won’t end and I hate it.

I bet in a few hours I’ll forget about all this shit too.

That’s the best part.

It’s like a story that never ends.

It retcons everything you go through and start ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLlll the way over.

Just fucking kill me at this point.

I’ve lived a terrible life that no one cares about so I might as well fucking die.

Won’t get better.

Just keeps. Getting. Worse.

Fucking send me to another fucking life please.

Any other one but this one.

Atleast in that new life I’d have a better chance of actually having a good one!

Who knows maybe I’ll be a girl and actually have fucking friends who talk to me.

Nah.

I doupt it.

Cause I’m fucking stuck here.

In this life.

In this annoying piece of shit of a life.

I’m fucking tired of acting like I care.

Why the fuck should I care when no one else does?

Why can’t I FUCKING STOP.

IM TIRED OF IT.

IM TIRED OF MY THOUGHTS.

IM TIRED OF MY WORDS.

IM TIRED OF THESE SHIT STAINS I CALL MY CREATIONS.

IM TIRED OF THIS FUCKING FAKE PERSON I GAVE MYSELF ON THE INTERNET SO NO ONE WOULD SEE MY PROBLEMS.

IM FUCKING TIRED OF ALL OF IT.
