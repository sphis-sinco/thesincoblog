# Main priority: `null`

## 7/11

For this section I was just gonna chill and continue reading the funkin.me blog. Take a small break from Dreamland. In 4 days I got the FNF 0.7 to get excited for with the mobile port. But right now? I just wanna, take a step back, look back, look forward, and change my path, cause on the current path it feels a little lackluster, boring, and I’ve lost what I’ve chased. **Fun**.

So yeah. Just, gonna chill, and do my thing. Wanted to make a comic ‘bout sinco, but I couldn’t even start it. :/

My baby sister and my mom were up but my baby sister decided today’s a screaming day so yeah, brought her to the front room with me, let her drink her bottle, and we chillin. I’m reading the funkin.me blog still.

Came up with 2 ideas: A rhythm game platformer, and a blog programmed by me. But I’m not doing either any time soon I feel.

I wanted to do some software development so I asked around and now I have the idea of making my own programming language in Haxe.

Will I do it…?

No.

I know the hell that will bring towards my mental state.

Anyway I grabbed my sister from my mother and hung out with her for a tiny bit.

I still wanna make a rhythm game…Infact no I wanna make **Friday Night Funkin**. More specifically? I wanna make a Friday Night Funkin’ where we got updates sooner, when the game was much less polished. Thinking of names I got Funkin’ Legacy. And it sounded good. I do wanna do this little side project, but instead of being in the base engine I was thinking it could be a good psych engine continuation. That’d be fun. Or how about kade? LOL. Imagine that. Nope, doing with Psych. Starting from v3.0, cause this is another point in time, a new point in time, a flashpoint. Where the game ended up more like Psych Engine. And they spent time over polishing rather then content. Saving the content for the first version of Funkin Legacy: **3.0**

# Main priority: Funkin Legacy

Starting off with 3.0 for the version mainly cause the official FNF 3.0 was the engine overhaul and weekend 1 update. And also in this timeline I’m talking about, weekend 1 was 2.9, and from 2.9 to 3.0 there was alot of updates just towards polishing and 3.0 was the MAJOR one that took awhile.

* Made psych engine compilable for hashlink
    
* Psych engine kept crashing and or giving erors: I lost motivation
    

# Main priority: Dreamland

I think I much perfer my projects, made for Hashlink, y’know? I also just understand it the most.

My thoughts on Dreamland were only for the last level for the main game so it ends up with 6 levels, and then I can call it 1.0 and then the game’s out. I tried asking around for feedback. But didn’t get anything.

When I re-entered production of Dreamland a few days ago it was because I noticed people liked the game alot more then my others, I asked some friends and it was because of the highscore system. And re-entering the thought process, I’m thinking of adding a results screen to help assist the dopamine rush you get from a new high-score.

Trying to do research on arcade and shooter game highscore and result screen is boring. Ended up scrolling U+1D54F (twitter) for any Funkin news.

I’ve come up with an idea for the next few updates now, **Variations**. The idea was there for 0.8 but I wasn’t told if I should do it or not by my friends. Think of it more like an extra difficulty. I’m going to call it “Overdrive”, it’s basically just an extra difficulty, or just an extra level.

As for how I want to implement it? I’ve wanted to redo the codebase for a while so I was thinking of redoing how the level select works with levels. Having new json files for the level select specifically, and also it’s gonna be a different JSON extension. “.dreamEntry”

I’ve implemented that and so far the only issue I’ve come across is PlayState crashing when it can’t get a value from the json even though I have null safety checks. Turns out it was cause it was looking for a non-existant file! Heh.

I’m thinking about shaders right now. But that would most likely require hard-coding. Which I don’t wanna do for this project, but I would love to add them eventually. So I’m thinking that 1.0 will be the last web update and that the project supports desktop platforms only afterwards, or maybe the update before 1.0. And then when it comes out there is a web exclusive build that tells you to play the desktop release. Web game development was never my friend, and I would like to stay away from it as much as possible.

So far there are 5 levels in the game, and I plan for there to be 6. With the overdrive variation there would be a total of 12 levels in the game. It’s actually pretty easy to add these variations right now, so what I wanna do is space it out.

If I do 2 overdrive levels an update, there will be 3 updates and then 1.0, excluding 1 overdrive level that will be with level 6 in 1.0. If I did this pattern: 2, 1, 1, 1. There are 4.

Realistically I would like to do 1.0 ASAP to escape web game development. But also I want it to be **quality over quantity**. Which halfway agree’s with what I want.

I’ll figure it out later. But I defenitely know There won’t be all the overdrive variations at once though. I’ll space them out.

## 7/12

I wake up this morning happy: I had a PR (Pull Request) from a friend I could check out. Though there was an issue of him assuming that you couldn’t compile to Hashlink so I have to fix that.

It feels so good to have someone else contribute to the project. Someone else helping me out in *someway*, shape, or form.

Anyway onto the compiling thing, I need to add a README. And I added a readme. Took abit, but I added a readme.

CoreCat approved of it so that’s good. Now re-entering my thought process from yesterday, Quality over Quantity is my ultimate goal. I don’t want to just rush out the levels, I want each of them to be a unique experience.

So instead of each Overdrive level just being like a hard mode for each level. I will add unique mechanics to them that will make them, *them*.

For earth (overdrive) it takes place in an underwater zone of the earth in this game. So I made it so that the player’s technology here is limited and they only have 1 bullet.

But also I’m thinking of letting each player type have a more finer control on their bullets. Right now they’re all the same, same color, size, and speed. And I want more finer control on that information. Looking into the code it’s pretty easy to replicate the current values, I would like more finer control on speed but right now that’s controlled by the size and I think that’s enough for me.

Implementing it was pretty easy. Not alot of challenge. Just changing values to look for custom ones. I feel like with this people can make more crazy stuff in mods now. And I like that.

Turns out with the new level select entry system, mod levels were completely broken so I had to fix that. And also I decided the mods menu should list the outdated “Crimes” as I like to call them.

Now I would like to put another Overdrive variation into the game, how about Hell? I could do that.

Got distracted. LOL.

Anyway I got straight to work and quickly made Hell Overdrive, pretty quickly and fast, so that’s good. Gotta say I’m very proud of the Hell Overdrive background.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752334493877/174e0b07-f913-48c0-893e-91ae440ed19b.png align="center")

Just makes me want to do shaders more. But right now I can’t…

Or can I?

Yeah, I can but they are desktop exclusive cause the web build can’t load scripts. Forgot about that but OH WELL AM I RIGHT? Ha!

Yay…

Oh yeah little adventure: When putting in the shaders for Hell Overdrive, I was having this issue of the shaders not being applied, the reason? A missing “;” that there was no log about. But there was also the missing flixel.FlxSprite import. But the semicolon was the big one.

Anyway I added a shader to Hell Overdrive and then Earth Overdrive and I like both.

I think the update’s done now so I export it and then post it to itch.io.

And now 0.10.0 begins development! I quickly got Heaven Overdrive out of the way and did a bonus of re-exporting all the OG enemies cause back then I only had libresprite, but now I got deems aseprite! After realizing I gave the OG levels Overdrive variations I laughed a bit.

Anyway, after doing Heaven Overdrive I was workinf on a shader option, and that was annoying as hell to implement into scripts, but I managed.

Finished 0.10.0 after a small fix in the mod menu. After a bit of deciding afterwards, I’ve decided that 0.11.0 will be the last version compatable with the web.

Working on 0.11.0 felt good. Knowing that the final level was right around the corner and I can do what I want with it without the worry of a web version. Hiku and Jujin gameplay was done fast, just the art that’s left to go, and I can get that done pretty quickly, which I did, and 0.11.0 is basically done but I wanna add more…I’d add a toggle for shader graphics but I can’t really think of a way of adding it. I guess I could add that results menu I mentioned.

I started on a little container that will hold the information and [I love my pulsing L](https://youtu.be/N5JYAcn7G6Y)! (Ended up being a \_)

Working on the results screen was pretty easy minus the player animation, but I did it. It’s simple and you can see FNF inspirations, sounds about right. I decided to add a little graphic to display when you get a high score, and because I already had a really high score I decided to add a “Clear Save” option to the preferences menu, and that is where hell truely began, everytime I closed the game the erased save wouldn’t save, and after probably hours of insanity I figured out the error, and it was because I wasn’t saving to `FlxG.save.data`, and only the variable inside the game.

But after that? 0.11.0 is done. I added a quick outdated screen message for web specifically, and yeah. It’s here. 0.11.0 is out and It’s time for 1.0.0 to begin production!

First things first would be the next level but I decided to do small stuff first, so I decided to focus on the results menu. I added a bad animation and struggles debugging why it couldn’t work (the issue was that I forgot to set the correct asset path.)

Overall so-far for 1.0.0 development I think until I’m like “Let’s get this out”, I’m just gonna add QOL or small things that can maybe add charm to the game.

I also wanna try to export the game to android so thats been taking most focus in figuring out.

Figured it out and I sent the apk to my friend and my phone, and I’m testing it now and will most likely be testing it for most of the development of 1.0.

First issue: Navigation. And the process begins.

I’m going to put my focus strictly onto the project now and just post some blogs as updates. The whole mega-blog thing is never going to be my thing.
