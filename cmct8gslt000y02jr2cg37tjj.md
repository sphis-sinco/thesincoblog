I’m working on a new project. “Funkin Simple”

It’s Friday Night Funkin’ but without the visual charm.

Friday Night Funkin’ but all that’s left is the banging OST and charts to break your fingers (with the charts from mods)

Like a few minutes later getting to input shit Im lost. I don’t know what to do. This shit is probably cancelled :(
