So yeah, after a few weeks Sinco Retold is back and is going to end soon the Nisoc saga will be the final Sinco Retold saga, and the next saga will be the true start of Sinco Retold Beyond. There will be a 3 year timeskip where we basically get the DBZ of Sinco Retold.

Longer, Crazier sagas split into Arcs instead, and the sagas will have crazier enemies. Think Frieza, or Cell.

I think I could move the Nisoc saga to Volume 6 and Volume 7 and onward will be considered Sinco Retold Beyond volumes.

Rest on piece the old SRB and let's welcome the new one.
