This was supposed to be like a mini-project I do in the background inbetween updates. But for some reason an android version of dreamland appealed to me so much it became the priority.

I’ve done alot for the android version and I’m proud of it. Glad I got it working. But at the same time I don’t have it working.

Turns out I can’t read files on android.

*Oh no.*
